<P>This plugin is designed for use with Raspberry Pi models with a 40 pin GPIO header.</P>
<p>Use all GPIO pins except for pins GPIO01 and GPIO1. You may use them too only after special configuration options have been applied to the PI.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The 5V and ground pins on the Pi can be used to power 1 or 2 relay boards. If more boards are being used or if more than a couple of relays will be turned on at the same time It is a good idea to use a separate power supply to power the boards.</li><br>
		<li>
			If you are using more than 8 channels and need to increase the number of stations SIP displays, open the <b>Options menu > Station Handling</b> and incrase the number of <b>Station extensions</b>. Increasing the number by 1 will add 8 stations to SIP.</li><br>
		<li>
			If the number of relays you are using is not a multiple of 8 you can hide the unused stations. Open the <b>Stations</b> menu and uncheck the boxes under <b>Enabled?</b> next to the stations you are not using.</li>
